This is my first blog post or GSoC 2012. I would like to thank my mentors Kathi and Marvin for helping me throughout the process of proposal submission, guiding me at each step .

I plan to build a web client to import slides into Connexions and upload them to a service like SlideShare or Google Docs to render them as embeds. The client should be able to create a module template with introductory paragraphs and should be uploaded to Connexions using the publishing API. Slides should be printable and should be compatible to mobile/tablet views.
